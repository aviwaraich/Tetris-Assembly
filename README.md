# Tetris-Assembly

## 1. Milestone 1: Draw the scene (static; nothing moves yet):
  ### a) Draw the three walls of the playing area.
  ### b) Within the playing area, draw a grid background that shows where the blocks of each tetromino will be aligned (e.g., similar to the checkerboard grid in Figure 5.1).
  ### c) Draw the first tetromino (at some initial location).
## 2. Milestone 2: Implement movement and other controls
  ### a) Move the tetromino in response to the W, A, S and D keys (to make the tetromino move left and right, rotate and drop).
  ### b) Re-paint the screen in a loop to visualize movement.
  ### c) Allow the player to quit the game.
## 3. Milestone 3: Implement collision detection
  ### a) When the tetromino moves against the left or right side wall of the playing area, keep it in the same location.
  ### b) If the tetromino lands on top of another piece or on the bottom of the playing area, leave it there and generate a new piece at the top of the playing area.
  ### c) Remove any lines of blocks that result from dropping a piece into the playing area.
